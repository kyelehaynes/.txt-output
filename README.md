You have data on each prospective competitor including the jumperâ€™s ID number (integer) and their best 3 jumps(floats) measured in meters. To qualify, the average of a jumper's 3 jumps must be equal to or greater than 1.5m. 

This program reads the jumpers data by means of the keyboard and outputs each jumper's ID number, average jump height and if they qualify into a file named output.txt in a small table design. Under the table it shows how many jumpers there are, how many qualify and how many do not qualify. Finally under that line the program also outpus the ID number and average of the jumper with the highest jump.
